TITLE: Randomized Optimization in Unsupervised Learning

1. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

   - **Optimization Problem**: The task is to find an input $x^*$ from an input space $X$ that maximizes an objective function or fitness function $F: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, i.e., finding $x^*$ such that $F(x^*) = \max_{x \in X} F(x)$.

   - **Fitness Functions**: These are mappings from the input space to real numbers, representing the quality or score of the input.

   - **Randomized Optimization**: Utilizes randomness to explore the input space $X$ more effectively to find an optimal or near-optimal solution, especially when the function $F$ is complex or the space $X$ is large.

   - **Theoretical Constraints**: 
     - Global vs. Local Optima: Algorithms can get stuck at local optima if they only make local improvements.
     - Assumptions about the continuity and differentiability of $F$ may not always hold.

2. KEY CONCEPTS AND METHODOLOGY

   A. Essential Concepts

      - **Hill Climbing**: An iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution and iteratively makes small changes to improve the solution. It stops when no further improvements can be made.
      - **Random Restart Hill Climbing**: A variation where upon reaching a local optimum, the algorithm randomly selects a new starting point and repeats the hill climbing process.
      - **Simulated Annealing**: An algorithm that probabilistically decides whether to accept worse solutions to escape local optima, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. The probability of accepting worse solutions decreases over time.
      - **Genetic Algorithms**: Inspired by biological evolution, involves a population of solutions undergoing selection, crossover (combining parts of two solutions), and mutation.

   B. Algorithms and Methods

      - **Hill Climbing**:
        1. Start with an initial solution.
        2. Evaluate neighbors and move to the neighbor with the highest improvement.
        3. Repeat until no improvement can be made (local optimum).

      - **Simulated Annealing**: 
        1. Start with an initial solution and temperature $T$.
        2. Randomly select a neighbor solution $x_t$.
        3. Move to $x_t$ with probability $p(x, x_t, T) = \exp\left(\frac{F(x_t) - F(x)}{T}\right)$ if $F(x_t) < F(x)$.
        4. Decrease $T$ gradually and repeat until convergence.

      - **Genetic Algorithms**:
        1. Initialize a population of solutions.
        2. Evaluate fitness and select the most fit individuals.
        3. Perform crossover and mutation to create a new population.
        4. Repeat until convergence.

3. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

   - **Optimization in Chemical Plants**: Parameters are tuned to maximize yield or minimize cost.
   - **Neural Networks**: Optimization of weights to minimize error on training data is analogous to hill climbing in a high-dimensional space.
   - **Route Finding**: Optimizing paths in terms of distance or time.
   - **Clustering**: Finding cluster centers that minimize within-cluster variance can be seen as an optimization problem.

4. KEY TAKEAWAYS AND EXAM FOCUS

   - **Essential Theoretical Results**: Understanding the conditions under which each algorithm performs well, such as the role of randomness in escaping local optima for hill climbing and simulated annealing.
   - **Critical Implementation Details**: How temperature schedules affect simulated annealing, the importance of crossover in genetic algorithms, and how hill climbing can get stuck in local optima.
   - **Important Proofs and Derivations**: The acceptance probability in simulated annealing and the role of fitness functions in genetic algorithms.
   - **Key Equations**: 
     - Hill Climbing: $x^* = \arg\max_{x} F(x)$
     - Simulated Annealing Probability: $p(x, x_t, T) = \exp\left(\frac{F(x_t) - F(x)}{T}\right)$
     - Genetic Algorithm Fitness: $F(x)$ guides selection and crossover.
