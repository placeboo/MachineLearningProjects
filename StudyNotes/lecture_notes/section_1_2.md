TITLE: Instance-Based Learning

1. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

- **Instance-Based Learning**: A paradigm of learning algorithms where the model memorizes the training data and makes predictions based on the stored instances.

- **Mathematical Principle**: The function $F(x)$ for a new input $x$ is determined directly from the training dataset without an explicit generalization step.

- **Definitions**:
  - **Instance-Based Model**: $F(x) = \text{lookup}(x)$ in the database.
  - **Distance Function**: A function $d: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ measuring similarity between instances.

- **Constraints and Assumptions**:
  - Requires a meaningful distance metric.
  - Suffers from no explicit generalization; sensitive to noise and irrelevant features.

2. KEY CONCEPTS AND METHODOLOGY

A. Essential Concepts
- **Nearest Neighbor**: Predict based on the most similar or nearest instances.
  - For a query point $x_q$, find nearest neighbor $x_i$ in the training data based on a distance metric $d(x_q, x_i)$.

- **Distance Metrics**:
  - **Euclidean Distance**: $d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}$
  - **Manhattan Distance**: $d(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|$

B. Algorithms and Methods
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**:
  1. **Input**: Training set $D = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$, query point $x_q$, number of neighbors $k$, distance function $d$.
  2. **Find**: The $k$ nearest neighbors to $x_q$ using $d$.
  3. **Output**: For classification, return the majority class among neighbors. For regression, return the average of neighbors' output.
  4. **Pseudocode**:
     ```
     function KNN(D, x_q, k, d)
         NN = find_k_nearest_neighbors(D, x_q, k, d)
         if classification then
             return majority_class_vote(NN)
         else
             return average(NN)
     ```
  - **Complexity**: Time $O(n \log n)$ for query with sorted data; Space $O(n)$.
  - **Convergence and Optimization**: No explicit convergence as no training phase; relies on the quality of distance metric and $k$ choice.

3. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES
- **Example**: House pricing prediction based on nearest house features.
- **Variation**: Using different distance metrics like weighted distances or incorporating feature scaling.
- **Limitations**: Sensitive to irrelevant features and high dimensionality (curse of dimensionality).

4. KEY TAKEAWAYS AND EXAM FOCUS
- **Essential Theoretical Results**:
  - K-NN does not generalize beyond training data.
