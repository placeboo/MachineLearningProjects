### 1. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

#### Decision Trees
- **Mathematical Framework**: Decision trees utilize a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. They map input features to output labels through a series of binary decisions.
- **Formal Definitions**: Let $X$ be the feature space and $Y$ be the set of discrete labels. A decision tree defines a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ by recursively partitioning the feature space based on feature values.
- **Information Gain**: Used to select the best feature at each node. It is defined as $IG(S, A) = Entropy(S) - \sum_{v \in Values(A)} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} Entropy(S_v)$.
- **Expressiveness**: Decision trees can represent any boolean function and approximate any continuous function with sufficient depth.
- **Theoretical Constraints**: Overfitting occurs with overly complex trees; pruning techniques or cross-validation can mitigate this.

#### Regression
- **Mathematical Framework**: Regression models the relationship between input features and continuous outputs.
- **Linear Regression**: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the error term, minimized using least squares.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression by including powers of the input features.
- **Cross-Validation**: Used to assess model generalization by splitting the data into training and validation sets, minimizing overfitting.
- **Theoretical Constraints**: Model complexity (order of polynomial) directly impacts fit and generalization; cross-validation helps select optimal complexity.

#### Neural Networks
- **Mathematical Framework**: Composed of layers of perceptrons (neurons) that apply weighted sums and activation functions (often sigmoid functions) to inputs.
- **Backpropagation**: A method for training neural networks using gradient descent; it computes gradients of the loss function with respect to weights.
- **Expressiveness**: With enough neurons and layers, neural networks can approximate any continuous function (universal approximation theorem).
- **Theoretical Constraints**: Susceptible to overfitting; requires careful tuning of architecture and regularization.

### 2. KEY CONCEPTS AND METHODOLOGY

#### A. Essential Concepts

- **Decision Trees**: Nodes represent decisions based on feature values; leaves represent output labels.
  - **Entropy**: $Entropy(S) = -\sum_{c \in Classes} p(c) \log_2 p(c)$, measures impurity.
  - **Pruning**: Reducing tree size to prevent overfitting.
  
- **Regression**: Maps inputs to continuous outputs.
  - **Overfitting**: Model fits noise rather than signal; controlled by model complexity and cross-validation.

- **Neural Networks**: Multi-layered structures of perceptrons, trained via backpropagation.
  - **Sigmoid Activation**: $\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}$, differentiable for gradient-based optimization.
  - **Local Minima**: Challenge in training due to non-convex error surfaces.

#### B. Algorithms and Methods

- **ID3 for Decision Trees**: 
  1. Pick the attribute with highest information gain.
  2. Partition the dataset.
  3. Recursively apply to subsets until stopping criteria are met.
  - **Pseudocode**: Refer to entropy and information gain formulas.
  - **Complexity**: $O(n \log n)$ in average case for balanced trees.

- **Gradient Descent for Neural Networks**:
  1. Initialize weights randomly.
  2. For each input, compute forward pass.
  3. Compute error; propagate backward to update weights.
  - **Convergence**: Depends on learning rate and network architecture.

- **Regression**: Predicts continuous outcomes such as housing prices based on features like size and location.
  - **Performance**: Evaluated via cross-validation to ensure generalization.
  
- **Neural Networks**: Applied in image recognition, language processing.
  - **Limitations**: Require large datasets and computational resources; prone to overfitting without regularization.
